# Getting started 
You will need python 3 to open up the GUI. Run roomsgame.py and press enter to start playing. Explore the castle by entering either 'north', 'east', 'south' or 'west' in the first text box. Take items from each room that you enter, by entering what you would like to take in the 2nd text box. In order to escape the caste, you will need to get to Mermaid Pool and retrieve the 'Mirror of Ecape' before health points gets to 0.
